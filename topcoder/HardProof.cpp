// PROBLEM STATEMENT
// 
You are preparing for an exam in Calculus 4. In the chapter "Abstract Fourier Series", you encountered an excercise in which you are given a collection of N statements and your task is to prove that all N statements are equivalent. For the purpose of this problem, we will number the statements 0 through N-1.





For any pair of statements x and y, you are able to prove that statement x implies statement y. However, the proofs of different implications may have different difficulties. You are given a vector <int> D with N^2 elements. For each x and y, the difficulty of proving the implication "x => y" is D[x*N+y].





The exercise is solved by proving a set of implications such that each statement directly or indirectly implies each other statement.
For example, if N = 3, one way of solving the exercise is to prove the implications 0 => 1, 1 => 0, 0 => 2, and 2 => 0.
Another way of solving the exercise is to prove the implications 0 => 1, 1 => 2, and 2 => 0.





You are not looking for the least difficult solution.
When writing proofs, your biggest issue is switching between easy and hard proofs.
Therefore, you are looking for a solution where the difference between the difficulty of the hardest proof and the difficulty of the easiest proof is as small as possible.
Compute and return that difference.



DEFINITION
Class:HardProof
Method:minimumCost
Parameters:vector <int>
Returns:int
Method signature:int minimumCost(vector <int> D)


CONSTRAINTS
-D will contain exactly N^2 elements.
-N will be between 1 and 50, inclusive.
-Each element of D will be between 0 and 150,000, inclusive.
-For each valid x, D[x*N+x] will be 0.

12,10,10,0}

Returns: 1


Here, an optimal solution consists of the following proofs: 0 => 1, 1 => 2, 2 => 3, and 3 => 0. 
The difficulties of these proofs are 11, 12, 11, and 12, respectively. 
The difference between the largest and the smallest difficulty is 12-11 = 1.
